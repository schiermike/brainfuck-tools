Brainfuck Tools
===============

I wrote these tools just for fun to make the (admittedly rather pointless) task of writing brainfuck code a bit easier.

[Here's a link ](http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/all/lang=BF) to a couple of problems if you feel the need to dig into brainfuck.

I also added two examples:

* **crypto2.bf**: adding 1 to a number of at most three digits, related to [this](http://www.spoj.pl/problems/CRYPTO2/) task.

* **substr1.bf**: Given two binary strings, A (of length 10) and B (of length 5), output 1 if B is a substring of A and 0 otherwise. Related to [this](https://www.spoj.pl/problems/SBSTR1/) task.
